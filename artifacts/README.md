# Artifact Programs

Programs that generate research artifacts.

## Directory Contents

* [bent-pipe](bent-pipe/README.md): The included source code simulates a
  constellation of satellites with camera sensors that each individually collect
  observations at the ground track frame rate and attempt to downlink all data
  to ground stations. The included scripts generate logs for a constellation in
  a polar orbit with polar ground stations. The scripts sweep through a
  collection of constellation populations and collate the corresponding downlink
  deficit.
* [frame-spaced](frame-spaced/README.md): The included source code simulates a
  constellation of satellites with camera sensors that collectively capture
  observations at the ground track frame rate and attempt to downlink all data
  to ground stations. The included scripts generate logs for a frame-spaced
  constellation in a polar orbit with polar ground stations. The scripts sweep
  through a collection of constellation populations and collate the
  corresponding downlink deficit.
