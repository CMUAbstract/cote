## Directory Contents

* [aoki1982new.pdf](aoki1982new.pdf): Calculate GMST in radians given UT1 time
* [astroalmanac2019sun.pdf](astroalmanac2019sun.pdf): Scan of the Astronomical
  Almanac page for calculating the position vector of the Sun
* [borkowski1989accurate.pdf](borkowski1989accurate.pdf): Converting from
  Cartesian ECI coordinates to latitude and longitude on an ellipsoid (as
  opposed to a sphere)
* [dod2014wgs.pdf](dod2014wgs.pdf): 2014 update to WGS84 with important
  constants
* [fliegel1968letters.pdf](fliegel1968letters.pdf): An equation for converting
  from Gregorian date to Julian date (no proof provided unfortunately!); note
  that the equation only works if calculated using computer integer arithmetic
  truncation
* [hoots1980models-original.pdf](hoots1980models-original.pdf): Original scan of
  Spacetrack Report No. 3; useful for checking SGP4 implementations with the
  original software
* [hoots1980models-searchable.pdf](hoots1980models-searchable.pdf): A nicely
  formatted, searchable version of Spacetrack Report No. 3
* [mccarthy2009time.pdf](mccarthy2009time.pdf): Some useful information on time
  systems, including a concise check for whether a year is a leap year
* [seppelin1974department.pdf](seppelin1974department.pdf): Scan of the WGS72
  report; Spacetrack Report No. 3 was published before WGS84, so SGP4 uses older
  WGS72 constants
* [vincenty1975direct.pdf](vincenty1975direct.pdf): Closed-form formula for
  "great circle arc" distance on an ellipsoid (as opposed to a sphere)
* [wertz1999space.pdf](wertz1999space.pdf): The "SMAD" (Space Mission Analysis
  and Design) book; Chapter 13 has a great overview of communications and
  references several more detailed papers, documents, and reports
